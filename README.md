# LLM Agent Skills Repository

This repository serves as a centralized collection of skills for LLM-based agents (e.g., Claude, Gemini). These skills are designed to enhance the capabilities of AI agents by providing structured knowledge, workflows, and tools for specific domains.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The skills are now located at the root of the repository for easier access and management:

-   [`/git-master`](git-master/SKILL.md): **Complete Git Expertise System**. Mastering version control with advanced workflows, safety protocols, and platform guides (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
-   [`/agent-orchestration`](agent-orchestration/SKILL.md): **Scientific Delegation Framework**. A guide for orchestrator agents to effectively delegate tasks to sub-agents using the scientific method and clear context.
-   [`/skill-mastery`](skill-mastery/SKILL.md): **The Gold Standard for Skills**. A meta-skill providing guidelines, templates, and best practices for creating high-quality, token-efficient skills.
-   [`/markitdown`](markitdown/SKILL.md): **Universal File Converter**. Converts PDF, Office, Images, Audio, and Web content to clean Markdown for LLM processing.
-   [`/scientific-schematics`](scientific-schematics/SKILL.md): **Scientific Diagram Generator**. Creates publication-quality diagrams (flowcharts, neural nets, circuits) using AI with iterative refinement.
-   [`/typst-writer`](typst-writer/SKILL.md): **Typst Typesetting Expert**. detailed guidance for writing idiomatic Typst code for professional documents.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use these skills with your AI agent:

1.  **Locate the Skill:** Navigate to the folder of the skill you wish to use.
2.  **Read the Instructions:** Open the `SKILL.md` file (and any reference files in `references/`) to understand the skill's capabilities and commands.
3.  **Load the Skill:** Provide the content of the skill files to your agent's context or configuration system.

## 🛠️ Creating New Skills

We follow the **Skill Mastery** standard for all new additions. Please refer to [`skill-mastery/SKILL.md`](skill-mastery/SKILL.md) for detailed instructions on:

*   **Structure:** Keeping `SKILL.md` concise (<500 lines) and using `references/` for detailed content.
*   **Format:** Using strict YAML frontmatter and clear markdown sections.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimizing for token usage and agent comprehension.
