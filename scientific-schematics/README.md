# Scientific Schematics (Agent-Native)

**Generate any scientific diagram by describing it in natural language directly to Antigravity.**

This skill has been refactored to be "Agent-Native", meaning all generation, auditing, and refinement happens internally within Antigravity. No external API keys, credits, or scripts are required.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Simply ask Antigravity in the chat:
> *"Generate a [Diagram Type] showing [Description] for a [Document Type]*"

### Examples

- "Generate a CONSORT flowchart with n=500 screened for a **Journal**."
- "Create a Transformer architecture diagram for a **Poster**."
- "Make a MAPK signaling pathway for a **Presentation**."

## 🧠 Features

- **Supervisor-Generator Loop**: Antigravity acts as a high-capability supervisor that audits diagram quality before showing it to you.
- **Context-Engineered Prompts**: Integration with `@context-engineer` ensures the sharpest possible visual output.
- **Multidimensional Audit**: Every diagram is checked for Scientific Accuracy, Visual Clarity, Label Integrity, and Logical Geometry.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: The process pauses after the first professional proposal, letting you decide if you want final refinements.

## 📊 Document Standards

- **Journal (8.5/10)**: Publication-ready. High density, clean lines, academic typography.
- **Conference (8.0/10)**: Professional grade for public speaking and printing.
- **Poster (7.0/10)**: Visual impact and readability at scale.
- **Presentation (6.5/10)**: High contrast, simplified concepts for screen displays.
