## Auditing a Skill

1. **Invoke Validation**: Run `python c:/Users/andres.rendon/Documents/Prompts/skills/skill-forge/scripts/validate_and_audit.py <path-to-skill>`
2. **Review Violations**: The script will check if `SKILL.md` is over 500 lines, if references are nested too deeply, or if the description misses the "Use when..." directive.
3. **Security Scan**: The validation also statically analyzes the `scripts/` directory for obvious bad security practices, exploits, or malware.
